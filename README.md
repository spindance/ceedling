You can easily install this gem using the following command.

    gem install ceedling

As described on the [ceedling gem page](https://github.com/ThrowTheSwitch/Ceedling "ceedling")
you can...

...deploy all of ceedling's guts into a folder.

This SpinDance/ceedling repository is a copy of those "guts" copied
from the [your new project name]/vendor/ceedling directory.
It is here only for convenience and the content has not been modified
from that which is created by the 0.13.0 version of the gem.
